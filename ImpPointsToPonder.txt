#Java
1. Everything is written inside a class in JAVA
2. Class name and file name should be same.
3. Main is a function.
4. Java compiler search's for a main function first while executing the program.
5. ; statement terminator
6. After writing code via terminal we compile our code: 
javac JavaBasics.java    //javac calls the compiler.
java JavaBasics.java
7. Variables like a,b,c, these are the names of variables and can be changed 
8. all names are called identifiers like a,b,c className, main and print function names.
8. Literals like 0,1,2,3,4,5  and character literals like 'a', 'b','@','*' can't be changed.
9. A memory has a block which contains its name, value and address.
10. Java is a typed language which means before defining or declaring anything we need to define a data type.
Data types in Java: a. Primitive    b. Non-Primitive.
 Primitive includes: byte = 1byte, short = 2bytes, char = 2 bytes [a to z and A-Z  @ % , ], boolean = 1 byte [True or false], int= 4 bytes[-2B - +2B], long = 8 bytes, float = 4 bytes[decimal nums], double = 8 bytes and Non-Primitives includes: String, array, class, object, Inteface.Every data type has its own size in the memory.
 11. Inside memory the spaces are measured in terms of bytes. 1byte = 8bits. Bit means single information 0 or 1. Combination of 8 bits is 1 byte
12. Java is a strict language so it is more safer.
